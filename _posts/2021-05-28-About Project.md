# Introduction.

I will talk about some of the things that i have done during the week, and what i'm currently working on now.  


# Body.

# Explanation.

Not long ago we were given the project to create a do to list app the only thing that was required of us to do was only to display information and create add and delete button, without the edit and check or mark button.

I remember the only things i struggled with was to display information when clicking the add button, so this week this is something i also work on, to display information and finishing adding edit and check button and improving the style.

Now i'm working on the project that we are given which is to build a recipe app in a list view, I've started with html and Javascript, i've also revised about local storage, because we need it to save our information so that when we refresh it, we don't loss our information.

# Conclusion.

I think i will start creating my own project to work on, they help discover some of the things that i was not aware of, that were not in included in freecodecamp.
