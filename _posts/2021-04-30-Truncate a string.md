Title: "Truncate a string"

# Introduction.

The first question i asked myself when i come across this word is, what is truncate?. To truncate is to Shortens a string down to the number of characters passed as an argument. If the specified number of characters is less than the length of the string, an ellipsis (â€¦) is appended to the string and is included in the character count.

I learned that the trunc() method returns the interger part of a number, and that this method will not round the number up/down to the nearest integer, but simply remove the decimals.

# Body.

I will use the same example that i have solved to show how truncate works.

## Example.

Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ... ending.

1. function truncateString(str, num) {


  if (str.length > num) {

    return str.slice(0, num) + "...";

  } else {

    return str;

  }

}

# Conclusion.

I will say i'm starting to take my time to understand the question before i can answer the question, I've just realize to spend more time understanding the question helps rather that rushing to answer the question.
