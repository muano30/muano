# Introduction.

Access array data with indexes, we can access data inside arrays using indexes. Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.

There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array[0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.


# Example.

var array = [50,60,70];
array[0];
var data = array[1];

array[0] is now 50 and data has value of 60.


# Conclusion.

This was easy to understand, i think is because the procedure is similar to what i did when i was doing, use bracket notation to find the Nth character in a string.
