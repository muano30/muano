# Introduction.

In this blog post i just want to share how doing project have helped me to learn more or discover more things. 

# Body.

I will say imagine learning how to drive on your own without having someone to guide you on what path to take what or on learn how to drive you will end up damaging the car. On my side for learning coding i had freeCodeCamp to teach me the basics , which at the end i will need to understand not memorising and apply those basic combined to solve the problems.

This how doing project have helped me, imagine knowing that to add two plus two but not knowing how to get the answer, my example sound funny but it happens, The project hepled me to understand when and how to apply the basics i have learned, because knowing that we have h2 tag it hepls but if you dont know where and when to use it is a problem to me, this is where the project helped me a lot to understand how to apply those basics.

I remember my first project was about html understanding on how to use anchor tag which we use for links on how to apply it, it was funny because i had that knowladge already from freeCodeCamp but it was different because this time i had to do it on my own. i will say doing project have improved my coding skills a lot.
