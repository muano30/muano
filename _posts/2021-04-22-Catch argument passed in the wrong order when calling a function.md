# Introduction.

I thougth we can write arguments in any order and the computer will be able to read the code, now i know that we need to write them in the correct oder to avoid issues.

Argument are real values passed to the function. The next bug to watch out for is when a function's arguments are supplied in the incorrect order. if the arguments are different such as a function expecting an array and an integer, this will likely throw a runtime error.

If the argments are the same type (all integers, for example) then the logical of the code won't make sense.

So we need to make sure to supply all the required arguments, in the proper order to avoid these issues.


# Conclusion.

I used to think parameters and arguments are one and the same thing, now i know theres is a defferent between the two.
