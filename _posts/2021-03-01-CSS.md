# Introduction

There are things that i thought i have mastered in css,but i cannot apply them without going back to freecodecamp and check how to apply them, then i decide that it is better to go back and do the whole CSS again. Just like typing i have just realise that the more you keep on practising the more it stays with you. I asked myself this question? if someone asked me to help him/her will i be able to help without referring.

# These are the things that i want to apply without referring back to freecodecamp.

1. Add or change the color.
2. Change the font size.
3. Size my image.
4. Add border radius.
5. Add background color etc.
