# Introduction.

I've been asking myself this question what makes native app better than progressive web app and which one is best for a beginner in coding between the two. I'm still a begginer in coding but i'm just interested in finding out what differentiate the two.

# Body.

## Explanation.

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are delivered using HTTPS rendered in a browser, can be added to the homescreen for a fullscreen, app-like experience. Native apps require an app store and multiple steps to download.

PWAs are designed to work on any device in any browser. Native apps are limited to a single operating system and require duplicate code bases.


# Conclusion.

The information above is not all the information about the two ,i just wanted to show how they differ and what make them different, I think it is important to know also how this two are build. And also find out what differentiate a web developer and mobile developer.
