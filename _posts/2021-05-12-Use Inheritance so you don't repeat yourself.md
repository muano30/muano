# Introduction.
 
Todays Topic under Object oriented programming is Use Inheritance so you Don't repeat yourself, There's is a principle in programming called " DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF"(DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any changes required fixing code in multiple places, this means more work and more room for errors.

# Body.

## Explanation.

On the freecodecamp  example the dog and bird had the same described method, then the supertype called Animal was created with the decribed method so that both dog and bird inherit the method.

What i have learn is that after writing a code we need to find a way to simplify our code if it is possible to simplify it, And to avoid repeating the same thing over and over again. The inheritence  was very usefull in this topic and i find it easy to understand.

# Conclusion.

I think object are easy to work with so far i haven't come across anything that is challenging for me.
