# Introduction.

Wongani present to us on how to apply ourself in JavaScript, explaining to us through code what we have to do when we are working with Arrays, Strings, Variables and Functions. I asked so many question but i will only talk about two. One of the question that i asked is that if we working with Function do we have to write a return, here is the respond "return explain that everything that we wrote on the code that's where it ends". 

We were talking about manipulating Arrays with push, pop, shift and unshift when i came with the second question.

The second question i asked him is where you have to add numbers in the middle of an Array which already have numbers and arrange them from smallest to biggest. He said i'm asking deep question as a learner let's start with basic question first but what i'm asking it can be done.

## Example.

var myArray = [2, 5, 6, false];

I hope the example above will give you an idea of what i am talking about on the second question. What i was asking about is to be able to add numbers and have [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, false];

# Conclusion.

The presentation helps me a lot to understand things i was not aware of, i hope we keep on having presentation every week.
