# Introduction.

In this blog post i will just share about package.json what it is and why we need this file in react.

# Body.

package.json is used to store the metadata(metadata is a set of data that describes and give information about other data, but not the content of the data) associated with the project as well as to the list of dependency packages. In order to add dependency packages to my project i need to create a package.json file it makes it easy to manage and install the packages associated with the project. 

The package.json file keeps all the different kinds of dependency i'm using in my project in JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) format. 

JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data-interchange format it basically a collection of names or value pairs, where the name will always be a string and values can be a string, number, boolean, null, object or an array.


# Conclusion.

I think it is important to understand why we need package.json, so that we will be able to make our application function without leaving out all the things we need in our application to work.
