# Introduction.
 
In this blog post i just wanna share with you javaScript concept you need to understand before you can start doing react, as we already know that React is JavaScript library.i will include the things we need to understand in React, i think we need to focus on learning the right things. 

# Body.

## Explanation.

### What JavaScript concepts should you know for React?

1.Basic data structures: variables, objects, and arrays.
2.Array methods and working with array data: .map(), .filter(), and .reduce().
3.Be very familiar with functions and a little bit with classes.
4.Asynchronous JavaScript: promises, making HTTP requests with Fetch API, async/await syntax can help.
5.The DOM: learn to create, select and modify HTML elements as well as their attributes.
6.Object and array destructuring are helpful for working with data.

## What five React Hooks do you need to know most of all?

1.useState: to store and manage data within individual components.
2.useEffect: to perform actions like HTTP requests or working with a browser API.
3.useRef: to reference JSX elements.
4.useContext: to access data from React Context to share data among components more easily [rather than passing props].
5.useReducer: to store and manage data across multiple components.
