# Introduction.

React router dom i just learn about React router today, i heard about react router but i didn't know how they work, had no idea how i will apply them on my project. I will share what i have learned about react router.

# Body.

## Explanation.

React router i will say they work similar to anchor tag we have used in html to link our pages, but the application is different from what we have done in html. 

First we have to install react-router-dom for our React project in visual studio code using terminal, then we have to import them (i will share how to use import in the next blog post). this is how we install react- router-dom in our project using terminal, we have to type (npm install react-router-dom) to install it in our project, what i want you to notice is that we have used small letters if we make mistake and use capital letters it will never work.

After installing and importing  our react-router the next step is how to apply ourself in linking our components, i will share that also in the next blog post.

# Conclusion.

I have just looked at how react router works and i think it makes it easy for us to navigate our pages. Another thing that i like about react router is that they work similar to anchor tag we have used in html which means i already know what it does all need i to learn is how we have to apply it using code.
