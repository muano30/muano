# Introduction.

I have been learning class component in react now i have just started learning functional component, i will share what is functional component and how to approach it.

# Body.

## What is a functional component React.

Functional components are some of the more common components that will come across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function. In the functional Components, the return value is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree.

## Why use functional components in React.

The core purpose of a React component is to define the displayed view and bind it to the code that drives its behavior. React's functional components distill this down to the simplest possible profile: a function that receives properties and returns a JSX definition.

## How do React functional components work.

Functional components are stateless. React passes a props object to the function, the code executes line by line, and the component returns something renderable. This type of component is deterministic; the same input props will always produce the same output

# Conclusion.

I haven't done any coding with functional component in react, but i have learned functions in JavaScript, as they say function makes us write clean and simplified code i hope this also applies in react.
