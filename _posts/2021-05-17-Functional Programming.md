# Introduction.

Functional programming is a paradigm of building computer programs using expressions and functions without mutating state and data. By respecting these restrictions, functional programming aims to write code that is clearer to understand and more bug resistant. 

# Explanation.

I'm not finding it easy to undestand some of this higher order functions which is map and filter, i do know that this are build in function but i think i will need to go through videos and more practice, because it is hard for me to use them, coz i was used to for loop which explains every step and that made me to understand how things are done.  

# Conclusion.

I think this is very special because we don't need to write a long code when we have this higher oder function they simplify our code, but i'm finding it hard to think of how i can use them for now.
