# Introduction.

In This blog post i will share what i have learned while doing freeodeCamp challenge, about cleaning up  project with modules. 

I think the word modules may confuse some people so what is modules - can be a single file or a collection of multiples files or folders.

# Body.

## Explanation.

When i was doing freeCodeCamp challenges i wrote all the code in one file called server.js for authentication and also for routes.

So the best practise to is to have file for each modules, so in this case we must have a file for authentication and also for routes, which means in authentication we will write code for authentication and in routes will write code for routes. 

I think this is the best practise for project because it will make it easy for us prorammers not to mix code or get lost in our own code that we have written, so separating files makes it easy to know were you need to make changes without getting lost in our own code. 

# Conclusion.

The most important thing is not to forget to import the right packages for our files.
