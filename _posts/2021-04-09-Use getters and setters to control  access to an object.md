# Introduction.

I will only explain about getters and setters without giving any example of how to control access to an object using getters and setters.  


# Explanation.

## Getters function.

Are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable.

## Setters function.

Are meant to modify (set) the value of an objects private variable based on the value passed into the setter function. This change could involve calculations, or even overwriting the previous value completely.
