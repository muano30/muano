# Introduction.

I've been wondering what makes HTML and JSX differ but since i started coding to me they look similar but i haven't found any difference, so i will share with you the the different between the two in terms of class.

# Body.

In HTML we have been using the word class to define HTML classes and because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. In JSX we use ClassName and naming and event attributes becomes camelCase for example onclick in becomes onClick.

1. code Example.

const JSX = <div className="myDiv">

</div>

The example above just showing how to add a class in JSX and how it differs with HTML.

# Conclusion.

I think it is important to know what differentiate JSX and HTML so that we can be able to code without combining the two.
