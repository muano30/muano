# Introduction.

I'm about to Start back end in FreeCodeCamp but before i can start doing it, i decided to go back to revise basic of javaScript. 

# Body.

# Explanation.

The reason why i decided to go back and learn the basic of javaScript is because back end requires javaScript understanding, and just to make sure that i didn't miss anything.

When i started doing freeCodeCamp i wanted to know how long it takes to learn JavaScript and the answer i got is six months, What i have realised is that coding is not easy but if we can spend more time in front of computer researching anyone can improve their skills.

When i started coding i didn't know a lot of things, but i knew how to use a computer but what i know is if anyone can commit to something the results will show.

I enjoyed doing freeCodecamp because they explain something to you, then you will have to do it following the instruction and if you follow the instruction correctly the challenge will pass. The most important thing about freeCodeCamp is to read the instrution and understand. 

# Conclusion.

Don't read to forget or apply yourself for the sake of completing the challenge because what i have learned is that the basics you learn in freeCodeCamp you will need to use them later and that requires the understanding, for example underStand what does push() do because it will also help you know when to use it when not to use it.
