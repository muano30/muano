# Introduction.

In this blog post i will just share the difference between authenitication and authorization, and the reason is because i used to be confused thinking that they are the same only to find out that they serve different purpose.

# Body.

## Explanation.

Lets say we building the app that require a user to login or register, we will need what is called authentication and authorisation.

What is authentication - is when a user is telling the system who they really are by providing username and password.

It means this is the process of verfiying who someone is.


What is authorization - is the things user can do according to who they are. It means this is the process to verify what specific apllication files and data a user has access to.


After understanding the two definition above what i have learned is that when building an app that require a user to login or register it means i will have to make sure that if a user have registered, they must have authorization to the app when they login without having to register again. 

# Conclusion.

Authentication and authorization are very important when building an app that require a login and register form, because if a user is using the app for the first time they must provide the information that will require them to be saved on the data base of the app, this will help to verify that the user have the authorization to the app or not.
