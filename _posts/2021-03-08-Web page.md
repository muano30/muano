# Introduction.

On weekend i was on the internet learning how to position and style the wep bage, then i decided to check other peoples portfolio web page and compared it to the one that i have build, honestly speaking people are creative out there and i want be on that level also. i know there's so much to learn and it cannot be learned in just one day.

Today moral check the web page that we have build, i think he just wanted to see what we have learned after learning Html and CSS, for my side i know there's is a lot i want to improve on when building the web page and i want to change my web page to look better than it is today and everyday i will give mysefl one hour to improve it.
