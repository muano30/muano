# Introduction.

I have just started with react freeCodeCamp challenges, in this blog post i will share with you how to create a simple JSX element and a complex JSX element that i have just learned.

# Body.

# Explanation.

The first challange in react was to create a simple JSX element and what i have learn is that JSX is similar to HTML. JSX is not valid JavaScript but we have to compile it into JavaScript.

They  declare a Variable JSX and assign it to div element without anything inside it, what was required of me to do was to replace the div element with h1 element with a text inside it.

Second challenge was to create a complex JSX element i declared a variable JSX and assign it to div element inside the div element i have to include the h1 element, p element and three unordered list.

what i have learn in the second challenge is how to write a valid JSX, because if we write invalid JSX it won't transpile.

# Conclusion.

I think it helps to understand the basics, before i can learn more complex things because what i have just learn now is something that will help me going forward.
