# Introduction.

I come across this word Pseudocode in javaScript under the topic "use conditional logic with if statement" i had no clue what it mean". 

# What is pseudocode and example?

Pseudocode  is a notation resembling a simplified programming language, used in program design.

Pseudocode is an artificial and informal language that helps programmers develop algorithms. Pseudocode is a "text-based" detail (algorithmic) design tool. The rules of Pseudocode are reasonably straightforward. All statements showing "dependency" are to be indented. These include while, do, for, if, switch.

# Conclusion. 

This is not the only information about pseudocode, you can search more. The only thing i wanted to know about is the definition and the example i have shared.
