# Introduction.

Today moral give us a web page to build and how it suppose to look like in terms of layout, but he did give us a hint on what we suppose to use which is CSS grid and CSS flex box. The web page must include a nav bar, heading, four paragraph, two image and a footer. The four paragraph and two image should be aligned horizontally.

# Explanation.

The challange i had in the previous task were how to apply CSS, i think now i'm starting to have an idea on how to apply it, i think is beacuse i'm giving myself time to understand which style will work best for the web page i want to build, to know how the layout should look like contributed to choose the style i want use.

The only challange i have now is to make the nav bar to be on the fixed position beacuse all the time i apply fixed position it changes the whole nav bar look, i dont have a solution yet but when a find a solution i will write about it.

# Conclusion.

I know there's a lot to learn and improve, But what i'm happy about is that i'm starting to have a idea and understanding on how to use CSS.
