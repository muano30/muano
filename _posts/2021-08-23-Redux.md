# Introduction.

 I have just started with Redux, I i will share with you what is Redux and why is useful.

# Body.

## Explanation.

### What is Redux?

Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called actions. It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

### Redux is most useful in cases when:

We have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app. The app state is updated frequently. The logic to update that state may be complex. The app has a medium or large sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people.

# Conclusion.

I just think it is very important to understand what is redux and the importance of it before we can start learning it.
