# Introduction.

In this blog post i will just share my experience starting from february when i started with the coding journey up to this point.

# Body.

I heard that best coding people where self taught, which means that if one want to learn coding it depends on how much time you spend infront of the computer dicovering ways to code.

I didn't know about HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT but i was curious and excited to find out what i can do with both of them combined, honestly speaking without researching i don't think i will be where i am now  with the knowledge i have about html and css.

FreeCodeCamp might be old but have taught me many things, like the basics of how to approach html, css and javascript, before i even dig deeper to learn more i had a little bit of a knowladge. But after learning the basic learning doesn't stop because is the basics that builds up the knowledge to achieve or to solve the problems we want to solve. syntax my be important but to me the important lesson i have learn is that we should be able to apply the basics we have learn to solve the problem we need to solve or achieve what we want to achieve.

Honestly the thinking is required when it comes to code because we use our thinking to come up with the solution to whatever we want to achieve or solve. I learn that when i started doing codewars, codewars doesn't need a lazy thinker be cause it really test our thinking how we understand coding language and how we can solve problems using code.

I will say learning coding is not a competition is about understanding what we are doing and knowing when apply it to achieve whatever we want to achieve with it, is not about cramming and memorising code, i will give an example with the simplest thing to why do we use push() method. when do we need to use equality operator or Strict equality operator. 

# Conclusion.

This all i can share for now ,although is not all i have learned, i can write a book about what i have learned, i'm enjoying doing this and still figuring other things out.
