# Introduction.

I have done all the basic of JavaScript in freecodecamp, i didn't understand some of the basic while doing them, but i will have to practice them again to understand how they are applied.For me JavaScript is more complex compare to HTML and CSS. 

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes. JavaScript fuction may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. There is Java which is different from JavaScript.



# What is difference between Java and JavaScript?

 JavaScript code is run on a browser only, while Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser. Java is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language, and JavaScript is specifically an OOP scripting language.


# What is JavaScript and why it is used?

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

# Conclusion.

I have to keep practising the basic everyday to get used to the language of JavaScript.
