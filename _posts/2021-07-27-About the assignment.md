# Introduction.

I will share with you what i have find easy doing the assignment and what i find difficult doing the assignment.


# Body.

## Explanation.

When i started doing the assigment i was lost not knowing what a wireframe is and how to write user stories and pseudocode, after doing a research and reading about wireframe i find it easy to draw a wireframe because is about how you want to layout things on the webpage, although not all the things like dropdown menus and other features cannot be shown on the wireframe but the idea of how i want the webpage to look like i was able to achieve it. Then the next thing was to write user Stories about the wireframe i have design, i also find writing user storie easy because user story describes the user and their needs like what they want and why they want it. I can say user story helps to create sipmlified description of requirement.

Writing pseudocode was the difficult part because as i have never done it before but after knowing about it i was still facing a challange of comming up with the code that works for my webpage, and i'm still facing the same challange now.

# Conclusion.

I enjoyed doing this assignment a lot even though at first i was completely lost not knowing where to start and what to do at the and i finally get to achieve the goal of coming up with the solution for my assigment to be complete.
