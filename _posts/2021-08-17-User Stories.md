# Introduction.

In the previous blogPost i explained about the user stories but i never gave an example of how a user stories should be written. After i got the feedBack on the assignment that we were given to write the wireframe, user Stories and Pseudocode i think the part that i got wrong was the user Stories part, i will share what a user Story should look like and how we should write them.

# Body.

## Explanation.

### User Stories. 

What i have just learn recently is that user stories consist of three part

1. The persona.

The persona of the user which the stories is written for.

2. The feature.

consist of the features that the user requires.

3. The need satisfied by the feature.

I have learned also about epic which is a very big user story and contain many other smaller user stories. 

# Conclusion.

When we write user stories we write them from a perspective of a person that wants that feature and stories will noramlly be written from the perspective of a potential user of the product or existing user of the product or combination of both.

I think now i have a better understanding of how i should write the user stories, thanks to tanille for how she explained it to me.
