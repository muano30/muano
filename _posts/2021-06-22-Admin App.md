# Introduction.

Admin App is the project that i'm currently working on, i will explain what is required of us to do on this App and what i have done already.


# Body.

## Explanation.

What is required on this app is to have an input of name, surname, position, salary and id then i just added another input of email. The App must have the edit button for surname incase the user get married and they want to change the surname, for position and salary if the position and the salary change. The data that have been submited on the form should be displayed in the form of a table and on another page.

I have completed the html and css part that require structuring and styling but i might need to change some of the styling, on the javaScript side i what have done is just to validate the form so that it doesn't allow thing that are not needed in some of the input but i will stil have to make sure that it works properly.

# Conlusion.

This project are helping me to learn a lot of things that are required when building website, like validating a form so that people don't just write things or submit things that don't make sense.
