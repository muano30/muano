# Introduction.

Another way in which JSX differ from HTML is Closing Tags in HTML we have tags that are self-CLosing or tags, that donâ€™t require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start, which is not the case in JSX and i will share with you the how JSX works.

# Body.

## Explanation.

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A <div>, on the other hand, can be written as <div /> or <div></div>. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the <div />.

# Conclusion.

What i have learn in coding is that syntax when codding matters, i think the syntax will be very important when rendering the components.
