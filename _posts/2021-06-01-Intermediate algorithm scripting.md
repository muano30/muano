# Introduction.

Intermediate algorithm scripting, the reason why i'm writting about this is because i'm having a challange in solving this problem Applying functional programming. I've learn all the basic on the JavaScript the only thing that i think i need to improve on is functional programming, recently i was watching  videos on how i can improve my JavaScript knowledge more especially in functional programming. 


# Body.

I've just realise that i'm spending a lot of time in solving this problems because i want to be able to come up with my solution without having to check the hit. They do help but as a begginer in coding i thing i should spend more time in understanding basic than solving this problem because without understanding it also makes it hard to solve this problems, I'm not doing freecodecamp to use get hit, but after reading the instruction i should be able to come up with my own solution.

Freecodecamp do help a lot i've learned a lot of things that i've applied when building project, just think i need to rearch or dig deeper for more information. 


# Conclusion.

They say coding is not easy, i say with commitment you can achieve anything, My progress will also depend on the time that i will spend with the computer learning how to programm.
