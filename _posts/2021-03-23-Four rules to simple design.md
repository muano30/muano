# Introduction.
 
Four rules to simple design, this is something i had no idea about but i'm glad moral told me about it, and i wanna share with you how to apply it coz this is what a developer need to do or be able to apply.

# Explanantion.

## Passing Tests

The faster you can find what’s broken, the faster you can change it. Test driven development (TDD) tells you exactly what method broke when you removed or added a new piece of code. Without tests, your code design isn’t good.

## Reveals Intent

Good design makes it really easy to understand the code’s intent. Having really good names for your methods is essential for this rule. The faster you can figure out what the intent of the broken code was, the faster you can fix it when making changes.

## No Duplication (DRY)

How many places in your code do you need to change if only one requirement changes? You want to minimize that number to only one place.

## Keep It Small

It’s OK to delete code you don’t need anymore. Sure, you spent a whole day on it, but it’s OK. Just delete it. Don’t comment it out and leave it there. Just DELETE IT. This keeps your code clean for when you’re going through it to make changes.
