# Introduction.

I have been asking myself this question that what makes a responsive website different to progresive website, i will share with you a little information i have between the two.


# Body.

## Responsive website.

Responsive website were the next step when mobile became popular,the companies were able to offer a better experience for mobile users, without the cost of developing natives apps. I will talk about native apps the other day, but what it means is that responsive website don't have the capabilities like offline support, such as push notification and other native-like features that the users expect on their phones.

Push notification is a message that pops up on a mobile device, APP publisher can send them at any time, user don't have to be in the app or using their devices to receive them. 


## Progressive website.

A progressive website looks like and feells like a native mobile app. PWA runs in the browser so there's no need to downolad the app from the Google Play Store or iOS App Store.

PWAs are meant to eliminate a range of issues from slow networks to data limitation or complete lack of connectivity.

Twitter is an example of a progressive web application. When you log into your twitter account via your smartphone's browser. You're now using a PWA that's capable of perfoming real-time notification, offline notifications, and other app-like functions.

# Conclusion.

I didn't know the different between the two, What i like about progressive is that it have the features of native app.

What made me learn the different between the two is that i wanted to know which is the best in connecting with the customers it terms of business expertise.
