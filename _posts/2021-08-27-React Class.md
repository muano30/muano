# Introduction.

I've been doing my React project using class component, i will just share how i find class component.

# body.

## Explanation.

I have been enjoying class components, i learn the freeCodeCamp way to build react app which is class component and i was told that its an old way of building react app, but it does have its own advantage, I'm not familiar with the functional components but i want to learn it after understanding the class component basics. 

When i was doing the project i learn that i can use the bind method after the state or inside the input, and i don't have to create a handleChange method for each input i have but i can use one handleChange to manage multiple input. I struggled a bit with the map method, but i think if we want to return a list of things map method will be usefull. 

# Conclusion.

This not all what have learned there is a lot to learn but i think the most important thing is to understand the basics first.
