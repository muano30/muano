# Introduction.

I was doing a topic "Use the parseInt function with a radix" when i learned about binary numbers, I will explain about the parseInt function with a radix, integer and binary numbers.


# Explanation.

## The parseInt() function with a radix

This function parses a string and returns an interger, it takes a second argument for the radix, which specifies the base of the number in the string. Radix can be an integer between 2 and 36.

## Integer

A number which is not a fraction or a whole number, means the number don't have a decimal fraction. 

## Binary number.

Is a number in the base-2 numerical system or binary numerical system, which uses only two symbols, typically "0" and "1". The base-2 numerical system is a positional notation with a radix of 2.  each digits is refered to as bit or binary digit.

# Conclusion

I din't know how to count in binary then i teach myself counting in binary and decimal counting and also learn about binary addition and binary subtraction.
