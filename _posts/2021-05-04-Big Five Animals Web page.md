# Introduction.

On friday the 30th of April we were given Six hours to build a web page about Five big Animals, The web page must be responsive to all the mobile phones, The web page need to include the following: 1. User must click on the list of animal to select the animal of their choice to view the information about the animal they have selected. 2. We need to add images of the animals and when the user hover on that image the second image that shows the animal that is making sound need to apper with the sound of that animal.

I will share with you what worked for me and my biggest challange when building this web page, and what i have learned about this web page.

# Explanation.

What work for me is that i learned about four rules to simply design and so far it has worked for me. My biggest challange was creating a function and responsive for mobile phones, so far creating function and coming up with the name of the function is a challange and responsive depend on the styling and we need to use media queries to make it responsive to mobiles phones, Downloading  audio or video tumi shared with me on how to download videos before.
 
What i have learned is that it is possible to build a web page in less that six hours, I thought it is imposible it can't be done in less Six hours.

# Conclusion.

Everything is challenging but is about how you challenge yourself and check how other people are doing it in order to improve, there is no growth in comfort zone but challenges makes us grow. 

Freecodecamp have all the basics we need to improve our coding, before i watch any video i start by undestanding what freecodecamp is teaching me.
