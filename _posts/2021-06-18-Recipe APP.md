# Introduction.

I'm writing this because we were just given a presentation today on how we were suppose to build the Recipe app. 


# Body.

# Explanation.

This APP was not as simple as i thought it would be, because the way i did it was completely different compare to the presentation. i think i looked for a simple way to build it, I was able to display my data and create a delete button and edit button.

What i did different from what was presented to us is that each ingredients had a delete and edit button in my case i had a delete button and edit button that works on the entire recipe.

Another thing that i always forget is to make sure that the form only accept thing that makes sense, like if the input is set to accept numbers it should not suppose to accept letters, and how many characters it suppose to accept.


# Conclusion.

I will say the presentation helped me a lot to see were i went wrong in building this app, what i am going to do is try and buid this app the way it was presented to us.
