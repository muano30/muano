# Introduction.

In this blog post i just want to remind me and those who knows about README.md why it is important to always write it in each and project we are doing.

# Body.

My first repository i created for my first project i was told to always include the README file, since then i always create repospitory for each and every single project with README file. A lot of times i will start by coding and forget to write the Readme file, It is important to write Read me file because it helps people to read about the project and understand what is happening in the project.

Before they can even run the project by just reading the Readme file you already have given them the clue on what is the project about, imagine the project without a Readme file where you have to figure out all the things in the project on your own.

React project also need Readme file, doesn't matter what project Readme must always be there on each and every project we are building.

# Conclusion.

I have told myself to always start by writting the Readme file before i can start coding, because we dont start builing the project without knowing what the project is about, before we can start coding we already know the project idea.
