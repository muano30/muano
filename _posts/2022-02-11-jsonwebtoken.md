# Introduction.

Yesterday we were told to reseach about JWT(jsonwebtoken), because on monday we will be given a project that will require us to use JWT so in this blog post i will talk about what is JWT and why we need it.

# Body.

## Explanation.

I heard about jsonwebtoken before but i didn't pay attention to it or try to understand what it is then, but now that i am told to do research about it, i want to understand what it is and why is it important.

What is JWT- is a standardized, optionally validated or encpryted container format that is used to securely transfer information between two parties.

Why do we use JWT- so that we can be sure that the sender are who they say they are. The stucture of JWT allows us to verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.
 
# Conclusion.

This was just about understanding what is JWT token and why is it important, now that i know what JWT is, i think i am ready to start with the project.
