# Introduction.

Hoisting in JavaScript is one of the concept in JavaScript that as a web developer we should know. I remember one of the concept that i have learned in freecodecamp which is about scopes and we have global scope and local scope but today i will talk about Hoisting.


# Body.

## Explanation.

A lot of developers get unexpected results when they are not clear with the concept of Hoisting in javascript. In javascript, you can call a function before it is defined and you won’t get an error ‘Uncaught ReferenceError’. The reason behind this is hoisting where the javascript interpreter always moves the variables and function declaration to the top of the current scope (function scope or global scope) before the code execution.

## Example.

What happens if we invoke our function before we declare it (with hoisting)

dogSays("hoof!");

function dogSays(sound) {

    console.log(sound);

}


The above code is not giving an error and i get the output ‘hoof’ in the console. This is hoisting in javascript.


# Conclusion.

I think it is important to understand the concepts of JavaScript. I never knew that calling a function before it is defined can work, i always think that function can only be called after it is defined.
