# Introduction.

In this blog post i will talk about dependency in react, all the time when i create react app i will find dependencies in package.jason and i never took time to understand what it is and how they help when building a react app, because all i was excited about is building the react app.   

# Body.

This is what i have learn about dependency is that is some third party code that my application depend on, my application depends on other people's code, a piece of code becomes a true dependency when my application cannot function without it.


# Conclusion.

Now i think i have an idea of what dependency is and why we need then when building our application, i was just curious what dependencies does to my appliction, and why when creating a react application we have dependencies in package.json file.
