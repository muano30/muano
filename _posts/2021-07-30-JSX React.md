# Introduction.

I have started react and i was introduced to JSX which is similar to HTML but it's not the same thing, so i will share with you what is the different between them and what is it that they share which is similar.

# Body.

## What is JSX and how it works?

What is JSX? For those unfamiliar with React, JSX is an inline markup that looks like HTML and gets transformed to JavaScript. A JSX expression starts with an HTML-like open tag, and ends with the corresponding closing tag. JSX tags support the XML self close syntax so you can optionally leave the closing tag off.

## What is the use of JSX?

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements. You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.

## What is JSX example?

This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML. It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”.

# Conclusion.

I think is best to understand all the concept in the react before i can start programming because helps me understand the some of the complex things.
