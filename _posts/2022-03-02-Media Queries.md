# Introduction.

In this blog post i will share my understanding about media queries.

# Body.

When we build website we build it using different computers, and different computers have different screen sizes meaning my computer screen size might be different from someonelese screen size, that is why we need media queries to make our website responsive to different screen sizes.

When i started learning media queries i had no idea how to use it but after giving myself time to learn how it works, now i can say i don't have any problem applying media queries to make the website responsive.


The best way to start using media queries is to know what screen size you are targeting, which helps in setting the media queries followed by what is it that is not responding on the website and how we want the user to view it on the other screen that we are targeting with media query.

Media Queries make it easy to make website responsive learn about it and understand how media query works, Imagine your website can only be view with one screen and when try to view it with cellphones other items are not visible. Media queries covers different screen sizes including the cellphones.

# Conclusion.

I enjoyed working with media queries because after completing the website there isn't much to do, with media queries is about making sure that alignment of our thing are exactly the way we want on other screens.
