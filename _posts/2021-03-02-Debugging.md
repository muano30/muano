# Introduction.

I honestly don't understand some of the challanges for debugging i was doing in the freecodecamp, maybe if i do them again and research more about debugging i will be able to understand. I will share with you the basic steps of debugging.

# What is debugging?

The important technique to find and remove the number of errors or bugs or defects in a program. It is a multistep process in software development. It involves identifying the bug, finding the source of the bug and correcting the problem to make the program error-free.

# Basic steps of debugging.

1. Recognise that a bug exists.
2. Isolate the source of the bug.
3. Identify the cause of the bug.
4. Determine a fix for the bug.
5. Apply the fix and test it.
