Title: "Add comment in JSX and Render HTML element to the DOM."

# Introduction.

As we know that react is a javascript library what i will share is how we add comment in JSX  which is different  from what we have done in CSS, HTML and JavaScript, and also  how we render HTML element to the DOM.

# Body.

This is how we add comment in JSX {/* */}, i learn that it is important to write comment on the code to make it easy to read or to be able to know that the code is all about.

Render means to provide or give so i think here we will learn how to provide HTML to the DOM. With react we can render JSX directly to the HTML DOM using react API known as RactDOM.

ReactDOM offer a method to render react element to DOM which look like this: ReactDOM.render(componentsToRender, TargetNode). where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.

As you would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.

# Conclusion.

I think it is important to understand the flow of the challenges we doing in the freeCodeCamp, I think this is helping me to understand how react should be constructed.
