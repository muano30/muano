# Introduction. 

In this blog post i will just share about mongoDB because i think it is important to understand what is mongoDB and why do we have to use it.

# Body.

What is mongoDB is a database application that stores JSON (javascritpt object notation) documents or records, that we can use in our aplication.

Why do we need mongoDB i think is because it makes it easy for us developers to store structured and unstructured data.

In the definition above it is mention that mongoDB is a database, we need database for different sectors to store the information, for example imagine working in a bigger company that doesn't have a database and everyday you receive a call or text from your colleague asking for your email isn't that frustrating, where as if the company have the database they can access your email via database. lets say for example we have a shop that receive product, we can create a database that tracks the records of how many product the shop have received or left the shop.

# Conclusion.

I think it is important to understand that database can be created for different sectors depending on the application we are building like university, social media and business.
