# Introduction.

After installing yarn i find out that there's a new file called yarn.lock and i had no idea what is it for, in this blog post i will just share with you what is yarn.lock and how it hepls us when building our project using react. 

# Body.

This is what i have found out about yarn.lock is to lock down the version of the dependencies specified in a package.json file, meaning that in yarn.lock file there is an identifier(meaning there is a block in the yarn file that describes the exact version of an installed dependency) for every dependency and sub dependency that is used for a project.


The benefit of locking down the dependencies version, if dependency where not version where not locked down everytime the dependencies are installed through yarn the fetched dependencies may be different. 

# Conclusion.

Now i know why it is important to use yarn.lock because we want to make sure that the same dependency version that we have used to build our project applies even when someone who is using different version with the one that we have applied building the project.
