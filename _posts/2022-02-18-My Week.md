# Body.

# Exaplanation.

My week was great after been told that we have to finish freeCodeCamp so that we can start doing client project i was so excited knowing that this will prepare me for work environment, I think doing client project will help me personally how to handle client and how to deliver in time. i can't wait to start doing the client project. 

I'm currently doing Quality assuarance in freeCodeCamp what i have notice is that the basics i have learned while doing Basic Javascript in freeCodeCamp have been applied, like strictEqual (===) to compare the object. What i'm trying to say by this is that the basic learned in javascript will always be applied everywhere if we still using javascript language so it is important to understand them and how to apply them.
