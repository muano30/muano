# Introduction.

In this Blog post i will just share what i have notice about displaying data in React compare to JavaScript.

# Body.

I i find it easy working with object than working with funcional in javaScript, i'm not saying working with function is not easy but it was easy for me to understand the object faster than functional, but this is not what i want to talk about today what i want to talk about is how i find it easy to diplay data in react compare to javaScript. 

React is javaScript library i do know that and is a front end development, i need to know javaScript in order for me to learn react. Everything was so simplified in react compared to displaying data using javaScript. 

# Conclusion.

Remember i was dispalying data not having back End which i'm about to learn, but i find it easy to work with react.
