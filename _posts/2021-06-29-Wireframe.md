# Introduction.

I will share about wireframe what it is and what to include on wireframe.

# Body.

## what is wireframe.

A wireframe is a two dimensional skeletal outline of a webpage or app. Wireframes provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, and intended behaviors. As a wireframe usually represents the initial product concept, styling, color, and graphics are kept to a minimum.

Wireframes can be drawn by hand or created digitally, depending on how much detail is required.

Wireframing is a practice most commonly used by UX designers. This process allows all stakeholders to agree on where the information will be placed before the developers build the interface out with code.

## What is included in a wireframe?

How many features are included in a wireframe depends largely on whether the wireframe is low, mid or high fidelity. However, elements that are typically found in wireframes include logos, search fields, headers, share buttons, and pseudo-Latin (Lorem Ipsum) placeholder text.

High-fidelity wireframes may also include navigation systems, contact information, and footers. Typography and imagery should not be part of a low or mid-fidelity wireframe but designers often play with the sizing of the text to represent the information hierarchy or indicate a header.

Wireframes are traditionally created in greyscale, so designers often play around with shading using lighter shades of grey to represent light colors, and darker shading to represent bolder colors. In high-fidelity wireframes, designers may throw in the occasional color; such as red to indicate a warning or error message, or dark blue to represent an active link.

As wireframes are two dimensional, it’s important to bear in mind that they don’t do well with showing interactive features of the interface like drop downs, hover states, or accordions that implement show hide functionality.

## Behaviour.

The behavior of the mobile app or website. On a website, the user will use a mouse or trackpad to navigate the page. The user can also click on certain features to reveal additional pieces of information, or even hover over certain interactions to reveal menus.

On a mobile app, however, users will have to tap the screen to open a feature. When wireframing for mobile apps, this means thinking more carefully about how you will encourage your users to tap a specific button to reach a specific goal.

# Conclusion.

I think now i have an idea of what a wireframe is and how to draw it, i think wireframe help a lot when you want to design a webpage because i will be able to show how i want to layout my thing on the webpage.
