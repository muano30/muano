Before i can practise to store form data to local storage i wanted to understand what is local storage and how it works, so i will explain what is local storage and how it works and how we can use it.

# Body.

## What is local storage.

Local storage is a form of web storage that stores data for a long time. This could be a day, a week, or even a year. This depends upon the developerâ€™s preference. It is important to note that local storage only stores strings so, if you wish to store objects, lists, or arrays, you must convert them into a string using JSON.stringify().


## When to use local storage.

You should only use local storage when storing insensitive information. This is because third-party individuals can easily access the information. Local storage can help in storing temporary data before it is pushed to the server. It is important to clear the local storage once this operation is completed.
