# Introduction.

Today i will share the progress i have made about the RSVP form project.

# Body.

## Explanantion.

Since i have started with Rsvp project i was programing the way i learned in freecodecamp, but i have just learn that the freecodecamp way is an old way of displaying data, there is a new way of doing it and can display dat by using map method. I'm struggling with the checkbox to dispaly all the information at once, what is happening now is that is displaying only one input for checkbox.
 
The class component was easy for me to follow based on what i have learned in freecodecamp, but i had to use an old way of binding and displaying data, then i had to try and use the functional way which have i just discoverd that in fuctional i can name the state the way i want but have to include the hooks.   
 

# Conclusion.

I'm enjoying working in react already i was just a bit confused when i started but the basic have helped me to understand. Now i need to learn a new way of doing project with react.
