Title: "different between splice and slice".

# Introduction.

I've just realise how important it is to know when to apply splice and when to apply slice beacuse both of them work in different ways and we need to know when yo apply each and how, so i will exaplain how both work.

What made me write about this two is because when i was doing functional programming i was reminded of slice and splice and how both of them works.

# Body.

## Explanation.

The splice() method returns the removed items in an array. The slice() method returns the selected element(s) in an array, as a new array object. The splice() method changes the original array and slice() method doesn't change the original array.

I was doing an example about the different between primitive type or value type and refference type or object type when moral add an example of slice and splice and the reason behind this is that i just figured out that primitive are copied by their values and object are copied by their refference.

 
# Conclusion.

I think it is very important to know how they both operate, so that we will be able to apply them in our code.
