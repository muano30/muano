# Introduction.

I've been thinking how can i make loop to jump to the next iteration, which i haven't seen. I know how loop operate but i've never try to do something like this before.

# Body.

## Explanation.

Make the loop jump to the next iteration when i is 6.


for( i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    if ( i == 6){
        continue;}
console.log(i);
}

Here the continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

# Conclusion.

I never knew about the word continue that it will work in breaking one iteration, i learned about "break" in freecodecamp doing switch statement.
