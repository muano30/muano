# Introduction.

We were given two weeks to build employee tracker app, the app need to have a form with input of a name,surname, working on and submit button that will add form infomation to the table, and create a table which will reveive infomation of eveything that will be submitted in the form, i must be able to delete, edit, save and check.

I will explain about the feedback that i got from the app that i have build and also mybigest challange building this app.

# Explanation.

I want to be critisized beacuse that make me work harder, i don't want to be told about things that have done right. I want to be told about things that have done wrong and were i should improve. The feedback that i got on my app is that i should not allow the form to submit an empty data, i must know the type of form that i'm building so that i will make it accept text or numbers depending on what is suppose to be submitted, because it won't make sense if someone submit numbers in a name or surname placeholder,  the other thing is that on the part of working on placeholder i should have make it a list so that people don't have to type anything but select and choose what their working on from the list that i have provided on the working on input.

The challange that i have faced on this app is building functions, i do know what is a function i can create a simple function and works. i know that function are usefull when building an app for example i  need to create a function for button to do what is intended to do.

# Conclusion.

Moral present to us today how we should have build this app, remember we were given two weeks to build this app, and moral did structuring and creating function in less than an hour. i was so inspired, and what i like about presentation is that i get to see how things are done, and i'm able to ask questions where i don't understand.
