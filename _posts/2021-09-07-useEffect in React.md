# Introduction.

I never knew about useEffect and what it does in react, in this blog post i will share what useEffect does or help us to achieve when build app in react.

# Body.

## What is useEffect in React.

By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we'll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.

## How many useEffect can be used.

Don't be afraid to use multiple useEffect statements in your component. While useEffect is designed to handle only one concern, you'll sometimes need more than one effect.

# Conclusion.

I dont know much about useEffect in react i just wanted to know what it is and and how i can apply it. I have learned that to understand or use this hook one need to have an understanding about the lifecycle that i have learned in class component.
