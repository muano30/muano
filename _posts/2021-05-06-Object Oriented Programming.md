# Introduction.

When i first approach this topic i wanted to understand what object oriented Programming is and what i have learn is that is about creating object that contains both data and function.

JavaScript is not a class-based object-oriented language. But it still has ways of using object oriented programming (OOP). A prototype-based language has the notion of a prototypical object, an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object.

Classes– Classes are blueprint of an Object. A class can have many Object, because class is a template while Object are instances of the class or the concrete implementation. 
Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented Language there is no classes in JavaScript we have only Object. To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype based object oriented language, which means it doesn’t have classes rather it define behaviors using constructor function and then reuse it using the prototype.

# Why JavaScript is Object Oriented Programming?

To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype based object oriented language, which means it doesn't have classes rather it define behaviors using constructor function and then reuse it using the prototype. ... JavaScript classes provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance.
