# Introduction.

Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier to simplify and maintain the style sheets for projects.

I learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to the styles.

# Body.

## Explanation.

### What is Sass used for?

Sass is an extension of CSS that enables us to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things organised and allows us to create style sheets faster. Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS.

### Is Sass better than CSS?

Sass is a meta-language on top of CSS that's used to describe the style of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS allows. Sass both provides a simpler, more elegant syntax for CSS and implements various features that are useful for creating manageable stylesheets.


# Conclusion.

The best part about SASS is that its an actual programming language, which means if i know the basics of how a programming language works, i.e. variables, arrays, and control structures it's easy to learn. Most importantly, SASS allows us to establish and use patterns in the code without resorting to cut and paste.
