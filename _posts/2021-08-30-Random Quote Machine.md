# Introduction.

I will share the progress i have made in the freeCodeCamp Random Quote Machine.  

# Body.

## Explanation.

In this project there are Twelve test that i need to pass so far i have passed ten test out of Twelve. In order to pass this project i have to fullfill the user Stories we are given which i have Twelve user stories to follow in this project.

I have completed five user Stories that i'm sure i have done them correct, the first user story was to create a wrapper element with an id, i did create the wrapper tag inside the Html and give it an id  which is given to me, then i created a div element within the wrapper element and give it an id. Same applies to third user Story, the fourth user story requires me to create a clickable element with id, which i created a button with the id that was given to me same applies to the fifth user story.

The project is not complete but this is how far i went with this project today, i'm struggling a to figure out  the user story number six, but i think i will have to apply javaScript target the id from my html page.I'm not sure if the idea that i have will work, but this is what i am thinking right now.

# Conclusion. 

I'm enjoying doing this project, But i think there's is a huge different doing project in Visual Studio code and in codepen, but my favourate is visual Studio code.
