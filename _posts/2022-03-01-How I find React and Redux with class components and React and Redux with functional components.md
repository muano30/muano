# Introduction.

In this blog post i will just share how i find redux in class components compared to redux in functional components.

# Body.

I learned class components in freecodeCamp before i started searching and improve my understanding, it was easy learning redux alone in class components but when i start connecting react with redux it wasn't easy, there were lot of things involed that makes code more. Then i moved to learn how to connect react and redux with functional components which was easy for me to understand or follow.

With functional components the first thing to do is to have a Redux folder inside this folder will have multiple folders, action, action types,reducer and store, then each folder must have a js file.

I will recommend that before you can start doing the code is importtant to have the basic understanding of all the folders inside the redux folder their purpose and why we need all these folders.

I have not given up in learning how to connect react with redux using class components, that is why today i have arranged with someone to help me understand to connect react with redux using class hopping that i will be able to follow and do it. 

# Conclusion.

To see my simple knowledge with functional components about connecting react and redux here is my git hub link https://github.com/muano30/react-and-redux-form/tree/main/src.
