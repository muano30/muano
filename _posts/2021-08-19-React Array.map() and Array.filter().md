# Introduction.

When i was doing javaScript i learned about Array.map() and Array.filter() method, i know that React is a javascript library already, and now in React i have just learn that the method i have learned in javascript i can apply them in React. i will share with you how this method can be applied in React with code Example in the next blog post.

# Body.

## Explanation.

We can not learn react if we don't have the basics of HTML and JavaScript because what i have just realise is that JSX which Stand for (JavaScript XML) is a combination of both HTML and javaScript, so it is important to have the basics or understanding of HTML and JavaScript.

# Conclusion.

I do understand the method already which i don't think will be a problem applying them in React, i just need to improve my understanding of this method, because i've seen the being used a lot of times.
