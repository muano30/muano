# Introducrion.

This is the part of JavaScript i solve a lot of problem without having to check the solution, although there were proplem even after analyzing them and getting the answers i didn't understanding. For the part that i didn't understand like always i will have to reseach to understand.

Basic Data Structures course, we learn about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to use in different situations. We learn how to use push(), unshift, pop(), shift(), splice(), spice() and (...) spread operator etc.

# Arrays.

Commonly used in computer programm to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.


# Explanation.
  
 1. push() and unshift() we use them to add items, this are two method which we can use to programmaticaly modify an array. push() add elements to the end of array whereas unshift() add elements to the beggining of an array.

 2. pop() and shift () we used them to remove items from an array. pop () removes elemente from the end of array whereas shift() removes elements from the beginning of an array.

 3. splice() remove any number of the consecutive elements from anywhere in an array, we can also add items using splice.

 4. slice() we use it to copy array items, and we can also use spread operator (...) to copy items, but slice takes two parameters.

 5. indexOf() we use it to check for the presence of an elements.

 # Conclusion.
  
  The proplems that we solved here made it easy for me to understand, the only thing left is how to apply what i have learned.
