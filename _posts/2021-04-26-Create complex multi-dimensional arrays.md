# Introduction.

Multi-dimensional arrays are indeed difficult to follow, it took time for me to finally understand the freecodecamp challange, i know that arrays are index based but when they were talking about levels i was confused.


# Explanation.

let nestedArray = [
  ['deep'],
  [
    ['deeper'], ['deeper'] 
  ],
  [
    [
      ['deepest'], ['deepest']
    ],
    [
      [
        ['deepest-est?']
      ]
    ]
  ]
];

The deep array is nested 2 levels deep, The deeper arrays are 3 levels deep, The deeepest arrays are 4 levels, and the deepest-est? is 5 levels deep.



# Conclusion.

After going through this example in the freecodecamp i started to have an understanding for multi-dimensional arrays.
