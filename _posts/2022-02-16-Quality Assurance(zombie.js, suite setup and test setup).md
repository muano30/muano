# Introduction.

In this block post i will share about zombie.js, suite setup and test setup, i came across this terms while i was doing quality assuarance.

# Body.

## Exaplanantion.


Zombie.js - is one of the lightweight headless browser that doesn't rely on additional binaries to be installed.

Suite setup - is a function (set of operation) which needs to be perfomed before running a suite.

Test setup - is a function (set of operation that) which needs to be perfomed before every test.zp
 
Mocha - allows us to run some code before any of the actual test run.

# Conclusion.

For me i think to be able to learn about something is better to understand it first, like for an example if we don't know what is variable is and what it does then how can we use it. The best way to learn about something and use it after is only if we know what is capable of.
