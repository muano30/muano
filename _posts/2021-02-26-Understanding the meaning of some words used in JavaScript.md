# Introduction

Today i just want to share with you the meaning or explanation of some words that i didn't understand while doing freecodecamp JavaScript, what they meant about variables,syntax, class, function and object.

# Explanation

## Variables

Is something that can be changed. We use variables to store information that might change and can be used later in our program, for example in a game a variable could be the current score of the player.
 
 ## Syntax

Is a set of rules that defines the combination of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured or the format in which words and phrases are arranged to create a sentence, so it is important to phrase or arrange words in JavaScript.

## Function

JavaScript function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A function can be defined using function keyword and can be executed using () operator. A function can include one or more parameters.

## Class

JavaScript class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data and functions that manipulate the data. Class should always start with an uppercase.Classes are just normal JavaScript functions and could be completely replicated without using the class syntax. 

## Object
 
JavaScript object is an entity having state behavior for example car, pen, bike, chair and glass. We can create our own object, beacuse JavaScript is an object language and everything is object in JavaSript. Object is a non or (pronoun) that is governed by a verb or preposition.

There are three kinds of object.

1. Direct object (eg. i know him)
2. Indirect object (eg. give her the prize)
3. object of preposition (eg. sit with them)

# Conclusion

When naming a function, variable or class, you should keep the following things in mind:
Choose a word with meaning (provide some context)
Avoid generic names (like tmp )
Attach additional information to a name (use suffix or prefix)
Don't make your names too long or too short.
Use consistent formatting.
