# Introduction.

We were given a project to do which is to make changes in the current TCG(The coding Ground) website, we were ask to add navigatin bar so that a user will be able to navigate TCG website. On the navigation bar we were ask to add achors tag for home, about,student, mentors and contact page.

In this blog post i will share the things that i have learned, enjoy while doing project and the challenges that i faced during the process.

# Body.

## Explanation

When i started this project i was excited because we were told to make changes using HTML and CSS which i have an understandng already. I was not doing this project alone but we were doing it as a group, meaning we have to sit down and discuss how we going to start the project,
Our first meeting we discuss on the strategy of how we going to making changes on the website, which was a success because we agreed on who will be responsible for doing what, and that we should have a daily standup to update each other on the progress.

I was responsible for doing navigation bar, about page, and contact page. what i will say is that before you can start building the website it is very important to design the wireframe first so that you will have a direction on which path you have to take, it also helps knowing what font size, font family and allignment of things etc while building the app.

I enjoyed doing the about page and contact page not the navigation bar because navigation bar have to be in each and every single page of the website meaning more work.

What i have learned is that working as a group is only possible if you have an agreement and both of you follow the same process that you agreed on, but the best thing in working as group is communication, i learned that as a group if you don't have good communication it also affect how you work as a group, i learn that working as as group means doing things collectively, and when it comes to present the work we have to choose one person to represent all of us, but we have to present what we have done to each other to have an understanding why they choose the approach they have choose so that we both have the same understading or hepl each other if there's a better approach.

# Conclusion.

The project is not finished yet we are waiting for the approval to know if we have to add anything or keep it the way it is and start working on the responsive. When the website was build we targeted the desktop screen meaning the app will not respond if someone try to open it using their phone.
