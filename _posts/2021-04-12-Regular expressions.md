# Introduction.

Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches.

If we want the word (the) in the following string ("The dog chased the cat"), we use the regular expression /the/.

We are able to ignore the uppercase and lowercase using the (i flag), we use it by appending it to the regex like this /the/i. 

# Conclusion.

I know what regular expression is all about now, the only thing left is to learn to match and search the text through code.
