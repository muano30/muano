# What is responsive?

Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it.

# Introduction.


The reason why i'm writting about responsive is because after doing moral project i wanted to make it reponsive to different screens including different mobile phones. This is something i didn't find easy at all, responsive is not as easy as i thought. I manage to make it responsive to different devices using media queries with two images on the left. 

Here comes the challange, i made changes and move the two images to the center then the web page was no longer responsive cause the image didn't respond, i try to find a solution on my own on how to make them responsive with no solution, then i asked JOHN how to do it he told me that i have to create a media queries for images to reduce the size of my image so that they can be resposive, i haven't done that yet but i hope it will work.

# Conclusion.

 John was also as student here at the coding Ground. Responsive is very important and i want to improve on it so that when i create a website it accommodate different devices.
