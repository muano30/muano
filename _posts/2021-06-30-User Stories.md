# Introduction.

I will share about user stories because i think it is important to understand what user stories is about before writting the story.

# Body.


## What is website user story?

 A user stories explains visitors possible interaction with your website. User stories follow a common format. As a [type of user], I want to as action so that it serve this purpose. Before you start creating user stories, it's important to know who's coming to your website.

 
## Writing user stories

Write a simple description of what someone needs, from their perspective, using the structure:

As a… (the type of user/role)
I need/want… (the goal)
So that… (the reason/benefit of the content)

The first part always describes the user, never the person creating the content.


## Why we write user stories

A user story is a common way of describing a user need. User stories help us focus our writing on what the user wants to achieve. Well written user stories also make it easier to write more helpful page titles and summaries.

# Conclusion.

The the only challange i have was that i thought features and user stories are one and the same thing. A feature is what everyone else refers to as an epic, A user story is a type of story. Epics can be broken down into capabilities which can be broken down into features which can be broken down into user stories.
