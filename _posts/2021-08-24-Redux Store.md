# Introduction.

Today i will just share the first thing that i have learned in Redux.

# Body.

## Explanation.

### A store in redux:

A store is an immutable object tree in Redux. A store is a state container which holds the application's state. Redux can have only a single store in your application. Whenever a store is created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer.

### Create a Redux Store.

This is the first thing that i have learned in Redux freecodeCamp challenge, Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state.

This also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, it must do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management in your app.

The Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There is a method called createStore() on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux store. This method takes a reducer function as a required argument. The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined for you in the code editor. It simply takes state as an argument and returns state.

# Conclusion.

Solving the freeCodecamp challenge was easy but i know i have a lot of things to discover, i also things it is important to understand what store does before we can start programming.
