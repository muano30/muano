# Introduction.

An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.

To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts, and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.

# Body.

What i have realised about this is that we are applying things that we have learned already, although some of the things have been added. What i know is that for each question there is more than one answer, i think this is  helping me to see if the knowledge that i have gained so far i can use it to solve the problems that i have been given.

# Conclusion.

Solving problems is not easy if you do not understand the question, what i have learned is that before you can answer the question is important to understand what the question want and then look for the method we can apply to solve that question.
