# Introduction.

Moral have added something to layout on the web page we were building, which is to include four heading, four paragraph and four button, and align them horizontally but they must be responsive in such a way that when we reduce the screen we must have two rows and two column. One of the second year student present to us an idea of what can work and show us some of the things to apply and things to avoid.

What i have learn today is that Bootstrap link that i wanted to use for icon have it's own margin and padding without me applying the style on the CSS but after removing it things went back to normal, what happen is that the class that i have named container which have four heading, four paragraph and four button were already on the center without me applying any style on it but after removing the bootstrap link everything went to normal.     

# Conclusion.

I'm not done building this web page and it's helping me to explore some of the things i had no idea about.
