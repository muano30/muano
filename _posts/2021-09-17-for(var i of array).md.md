# Introduction.

In this blog post i will share another way to use loop in array


# Body.

## Explanation.

As we all know, the ES6 is a milestone for JavaScript. Many great features were introduced by this version. The “for…of…” method is one of them. It makes things more elegant.

For example, we can iterate the items of an array like the following:

let author = [ 'Y', 'a', 'n', 'g' ];

for (let char of author){
    
    console.log(char);
}

# Conlcusion.

I think this is way better than what i have learned in freecodecamp, i do know that we need to understand where they comes from which i did learn in freecodecamp, but this is very easy to write and follow. From now on this is how i will write the loop statement whenever i want to use it.
