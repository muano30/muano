# Introduction.

The reason why i'm doing this chapter again is because when i was doing it for the first time i didn't understand it, and i think is beacause i didn't use the right approach , after doing some research and asking other people how to approach this chapter i think now i have a better approach to understand what JavaScript is all about. Another thing i told myself is that there's no point to continue going forward but leaving something i didn't understand behind, because the reason why we doing freecodecamp is to get the knowledge and have an understanding.

# Conclusion.

 I'm happy i find it early that i was applying the wrong approach to learn JavaScript in freecodecamp.
