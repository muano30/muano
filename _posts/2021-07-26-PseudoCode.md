# Introduction.

# Body.

## What is pseudocode.

 Pseudocode is an informal way of programming description that does not require any strict programming language syntax or underlying technology considerations. It is used for creating an outline or a rough draft of a program. Pseudocode summarizes a program's flow, but excludes underlying details.

## Rules for Writing Pseudocode.

1. Write one statement per line.
2. Capitalize Initial Keywords.
3. Indent to show hierarchy.
4. End Multiline Structure.
5. Keep statements language independent.

## Why is pseudocode necessary?

The programming process is a complicated one. You must first understand the program specifications, of course, Then you need to organize your thoughts and create the program. This is a difficult task when the program is not trivial. You must break the main tasks that must be accomplished into smaller ones in order to be able to eventually write fully developed code. Writing pseudocode will save you time later during the construction and testing phase of a program's development.

# Conclusion.

It was easy to write pseudocode the difficult part is to translate it to javascript language. I learn about pseudocode while doing freecodecamp, i never thought of applying this when writting javascript code, i think i will have a small project and start by writting the pseudocode before writing javascript code.
