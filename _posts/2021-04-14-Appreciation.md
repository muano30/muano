# Introduction.
 
I'm learning how to code in the institution called The coding ground, there were people who where there before me and learn how to code in a space of two years and their currentlyboth employed. The reason why i'm writing this blog post is to appreciate them for the motivation and sharing with us how their journey was at the coding ground.  

Not that i haven't learned or done anything today related to coding, but something in me tells me that i must write this blog post to thank all the people who have took their time to come and share with us the their journey in the coding ground, i really appreciate your motivation.

They all started by saying they had no background in coding, but with dedication and determination and putting more hard work in learning how to code worked for them, they shared with us to use our time wisely, nothing comes easy but comes through hard work, the small step we take in learning is a progress.

# Conclusion.

You have inspired me a lot with your motivation, All the things that you have said i've listened, you have no idea how those motivation have done to me individually, Honestly i don't have any knowledge or skills in coding, but i know i have passion in learning new things or studying, I just want to say thank you.
