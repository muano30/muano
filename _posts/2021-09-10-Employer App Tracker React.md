# Introduction.

We were given a project to build an App with React that will help Employer to have record of the employee. The employer must be able to add, view list and edit. I will talk about what i find challenging and what i find easy on this App. 

# Body.

On the App like they say the employer have to navigate Add, View List and Edit on the nav bar, which i find easy to todo after installing react router dom which help us to link our page. The next part that was easy was to display form data on the view list.

I had a challange with checkbox again like the previous project, i struggled to make checkbox work the way it is suppose to work i spend a lot of time trying to make my checkbox work, this is what i have manage to achieve so far on the app. The edit part i haven't started it hope it wont be that much of a challange.

# Conclusion.

I had a lot of fun doing this project and i learned a lot, i was able to see where i need to improve. My biggest challenge is making the app responsive because when i start adding style the app become unresponsive.
