# Introduction.

We were given a project to build a countDownTimer, in this blog post i will share what i have done on the project what was easy and what was difficul.


# Body.

When i started with this project i had a huge plan in my mind of how i want my CountDownTimer to look like but the difficult part was to come up with a code to make it come to alive or to exist.

The first thing that came in my mind was the challenge that i have solved in freeCodeCamp about increment, decrement and reset but in this case we had to click the button for increment to increase or decrement to decrease or reset to start it to zero, then i realised that the countDown have to do it automatically.

I did a project of countdowntimer with javaScript and when i was doing it was just for my understanding, i manage to come up with a countDown using react with the help of Youtube ,what i like about youtube is that when they build something they explain the reason why they are doing it and that hepls for understanding, the video that i have watched the app was done functionally not in class component. i will the easy part in this project was watching youtube when someone was doing it, but the difficult part came when i had to apply myself after waching the video.

# Conclusion.

I did enjoy doing the project it was challenging build this coutDownTimer, i want to try building it using components because here i was using functional.
