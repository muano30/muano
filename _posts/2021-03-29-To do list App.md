# Introduction.

I'm currently working on T0 do list App which they want on thursday, the App must have a heading, placeholder and submit button, all these need to work which means when i type anything in the placeholder and click the submit button they must appear under the placeholder.
o
# Body.

I have done the Html and Css part but the JavaScript part which i have to write the function in order for my App to work is the part that i want to understand which function to apply, and i think the reason why i'm struggling is beacause i'm still learning how function works and how to apply them, I have videos to watch for JavaScript about function. I asked moral to give us a presentation about Recursion a function that repeat itself until it doesn't.

# Conclusion.

My goal is to make this App work before thursday, which means more research and applying diffetent function untill it works.
