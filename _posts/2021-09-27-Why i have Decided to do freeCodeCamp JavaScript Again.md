# Introduction.

I'm about to Start Back end Development and APIs in freeCodeCamp, but before i can start doing it i have decided to do revision about JavaScript in freeCodeCamp.

# Body.

# Explanation.

The reason why i have decided to go back and learn it again was just to test if i have understood or if i can still apply the knowledge i have learn while doing freeCodeCamp.

Another thing that i have learned is that i should be able to think how i can solve a problem using code not just memorise code. There were lot of terms used in freeCodeCamp and i think i will still come across may more terms which i haven't seen before and i'm getting used to those terms now, what i have found out is that all the basics i have learned need to stay with me because i will need to apply them all the time.

I enjoyed doing freeCodeCamp, what i like about freeCodeCamp is that they explain what you need to do and if you read and follow the instruction correctly you will be able to solve the challenge, if you dont follow the instruction the challange will not pass. 

# Conclusion.

I think its owk to always test yourself if you have learned and understood, or going back to check your knowledge. Remember synax is very important when writing code.
