# Introduction.

Concatenate, concatenation, or concat is a term that describes combining a string, array, text, or other data. 

The concat() method is used to join two or more strings. This method does not change the existing strings, but returns a new string containing the text of the joined strings.The concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.

# Body.

Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays.


# Conclusion.

It was easy for me to understand this method and i think is because i knew what concatenating is all about, I learned about concatenating string using template leteral and plus operator when i was doing basic JavaScript and ES6.
