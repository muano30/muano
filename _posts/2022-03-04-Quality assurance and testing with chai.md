# Introduction.

This blog post is about testing library that i have just learned in FreeCodeCamp, which is chai, i haven't apply it practically with a project, i have just practise it solving freeCodeCamp challenges. 

# Body.

# Explanation.

Chai - Is a javascript testing library that helps me to make sure that my program still behaves the same way i expect it to behave after making changes in my code.

Using chai code we can write the test that describes our program requirements and see if the program meets them.

javaScript assertion - The usual meaning of an assert function is to throw an error if the expression passed into the function is false; this is part of the general concept of assertion checking. Usually assertions are used only in "testing" or "debug" builds and stripped out of production code. 


We can test if variable or function is defined, meaning changes will happen based if it is define or undefined.

We can also test using assert.isOk and assert.isNotOk, isOk() or isNotOk() this will check for truthy value and falsy.

We can also test for truthiness in our app, isTrue() test for boolian value true, and isNotTrue() will pass when given anything but the boolean value of true.


The test i have explained above are few of the test that i have completed in FreeCodeCamp challenge, what i have notice is that testing is not as hard as i have thought, just need to understand what is it that i'm testing on the app.
