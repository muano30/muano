# Introduction.

I decided to do a small project about css and html just to apply my knowledge without referring, because i was focussing on JavaScript. When i started coding the biggest challange i was facing was to style a web page, now i'm happy with my progress when it comes to html and css, i'm finding it easy to style the web page.

After learning the basics of both html and css in freecodecamp i realise that freecodecamp alone is not enough i had to dig deeper to understand, and it has helped me a lot in improving my skills on both html and css. What i have done is to watch videos and keep on practising without copying.

# Conclusion

I think it is important to learn more after understanding the basics, i'm saying this because it worked for me, watching videos to see how others are doing it.
