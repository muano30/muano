# Introduction.

In this project i have build an RSVP form to invite people to a party, the form need have name ,surname, age, gender, food and attendence, all the information should be submitted. in this Blog post i will share what i have done and what have helped me to build this app.
 
# Body.

## Explanation

In this RSVP form the gender part need to be A radio button, which will be either female or male and a person need to choose one but not both, on the other part of food need to be checkBox which a person can select all check or not depending on their choice.

When i started this project what came to my mind  was a challange that i have solved about input and form in freeCodeCamp, the only challenge that i had was that the was only one input in challange i have solved in freeCodeCamp  but i struggled to get data when i had two input but i finally find a solution to get the data for the second input. creating a form was easy as i have learn it in freeCodeCamp but creating function was not that difficult i had a challange. 

In this project i used class component to build it, what i told myself is that if i can be able to get the data of firstname and surname when i console log handleSubmit() then i should be able to to print them out in my form which i struggled a bit but finally able to it.

# Conclusion.

This project helps me discover some of the things that was not shared on the freeCodeCamp.
