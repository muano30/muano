# Introduction.

When i was learning CSS i have seen a lot of the word webkit-transition use but i had no clue what it is, but it was applied mostly in css. So i wanted to learn more about webkit-transition then i find an article saying the feature is no longer recommended, i skipped it so that i will learn it later, today i wanted to learn about it then i found out that i have to have a knowledge about web browser engine. in this blog post i will just share about the web browser engine and rendering engine.
 
# Body.

Browser engine is the interface for querying and manipulating the rendering engine whereas rendering engine is reponsible for dispalying the requested content, for example if the requested content is HTML it is responsible for parsing the HTML and CSS and displaying the parsed content on the screen.

# Conclusion.

Now i know what this two does so the next step is to learn to apply them, which i will share when i have an understanding on how they both works.
